User Stories:

   As any user of the TA bot site, I want the site to be well-organized and have an easily accessible structure as this application is meant to be a quick and easy alternative to scouring the syllabus or other sections of the course.
   
   As a student, I want any question the TA bot can't answer to be noted for the professor to add input to so students with the same question in the future have an answer.
   
   As a professor, I want to be able to quickly add my own answers to questions that are not included in the basic questions when first setting up the TA bot.
   
   As a visiting student, I want to quickly access my course with a course code so the application feels seamless without much hassle to begin interacting with the TA bot.
